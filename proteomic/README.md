# Proteomic

This file contains the scripts used for the proteomic extraction and analysis.

The "transformtabletomultipletables" transforms a dataframe containing every information from the proteogenomic into a table of counts for each sample.

The proteomic exploratory analysis was done using the autoexplo from the transcriptomic part.
