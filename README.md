# InsternshipIrba
This repositery compiles most of Maxence LECHEMIA's work during his internship in the IRBA.
The goal of the internship was to study _Burkholderia Pseudoomallei_ antibiotic resistance mechanisms using bioinformatics tools. 

Transcriptomics and multi-omics packages were used during the project, such as DESEQ2 (R) and WGCNA (R)

The project is divided in 4 parts:



#Transcriptomic:

  -> Annotation enrichment using the transcriptomic dataset and a GFF (General file format)
  
  -> Use of DESeq2 package to analyse gene expression and create heatmaps
  
  -> Automation of the DESeq2 pipeline for future uses




#Proteomic:

  ->Test of the proteomic dataset
  
  -> Exploratory analysis



  
#Genomic:

  -> Extraction from breseq output 
  
  -> Translation of useful data into a table of counts of mutations



  
#Multi-Omic:

  -> Single-omic study on WGCNA: a validation of the process with transcriptomic
  
  -> Enriching WGCNA transcriptomic model: added value of proteomic data
  
  -> Enriching WGCNA transcriptomic model: added value of genomic data
  
  -> Combining the three biological layers
